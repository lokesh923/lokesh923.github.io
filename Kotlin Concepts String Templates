In this File I am describing few concepts of Kotlin String and its String Templates.

String Basic Concepts: -
Strings are a sequence of characters. For example, “lokesh bagora”
 is a string literal.
In Kotlin, all strings are objects of String class. Meaning, string literals such as “lokesh bagora” are implemented as instances of this class.


How to create a string Variable: -

Val mystring=”lokesh bagora”


How to access characters of a String:-
Val mystring=”lokesh bagora”
Val item= mystring[2]

Iterate through a string:-
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    val myString = "Hey!"

    for (item in myString) {
        println(item)
    }
}
Kotlin String Templates
Kotlin has an awesome feature called string templates that allows strings to contain template expressions.
A string template expression starts with a dollar sign $. Here are few examples:


fun main(args: Array<String>) {

    val myInt = 5;
    val myString = "myInt = $myInt"

    println(myString)
}

When you run the program, the output will be:
Output :- 5

It is because the expression $myInt (expression starting with $ sign) inside the string is evaluated and concatenated into the string.
